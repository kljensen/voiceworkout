# Voice workout helper

This code creates a computer voice that walks you through
a workout, similar to my shell interval trainer. In this 
case, there is some interaction with the program due to the
inclusion of exercises that are not timed, but rather a
certain number of reps, which requires the user to touch
a key to continue the program when the reps are done.
